--- how to install and run elephas on Cooley
--- first, set up environment

conda create -n "test_env" python=2.7 anaconda
source activate test_env

--- install elephas
--- I found that installing elephas from source gives error ("can't pickle ellipsis objects") 
--- so it's better to install with pip:

pip install elephas
pip install keras==0.3.3

--- note that the current (dec 2017) version of elephas on pip requires keras 0.3.3!
--- also make sure to install tensorflow
pip install /soft/libraries/unsupported/tensorflow-whl-1.3.0/tensorflow-1.3.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl

--- use the dataflow scripts to submit a job that creates a spark cluster on cooley:
./submit-spark.sh datascience 01:00:00 4 debug

--- now you can either stay in the login node or ssh into the master node. 
--- If you call spark-submit on the login node, elephas will treat the login node as the master node
--- In any case, set these environment variables:
export SPARK_MASTER_URI=spark://cc006:7077
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=~/anaconda2/envs/test_env/bin/python

--- go to your spark installation directory
--- then call spark_submit:
./bin/spark-submit --master $SPARK_MASTER_URI ../elephas-explorations/elephas-test.py --nw 4 --ne 10 --bs 32

--- this will train a parallelized CNN on MNIST data.
