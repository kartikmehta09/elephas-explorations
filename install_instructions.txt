--- how to install and run elephas on Cooley ---


1. environment

- make sure to have the following in your soft environment at ~/.soft.cooley:

+cuda-7.5.18
+java-1.8.0.60
LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=/soft/libraries/unsupported/cudnn-7.5.1/cuda/lib64
@default

- if you do not have your own anaconda installation, also add this: 

+anaconda3-4.0.0

- now create a new conda environment for installing tensorflow, keras, and elephas:

conda create -n "test_env" python=2.7 anaconda
source activate test_env



2. install elephas, keras, and tensorflow

- I found that installing elephas from source gives an error ("can't pickle ellipsis objects") (as of December 2017), so it's better to install with pip:

pip install elephas

- this version of elephas (again, as of December 2017) requires Keras 0.3.3, so install that version:

pip install keras==0.3.3

- install tensorflow from the wheel optimized for Cooley's GPUs:

pip install /soft/libraries/unsupported/tensorflow-whl-1.3.0/tensorflow-1.3.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl



3. run elephas

- use the dataflow scripts (documented elsewhere) to submit a job that creates a spark cluster on cooley:

./submit-spark.sh datascience 01:00:00 4 debug

- now you can either stay in the login node or ssh into the master node. 
- if you stey in the login node, the elephas parameter server will be the login node
- if you ssh into the head node, this will be the elephas parameter server
- set these environment variables:

export SPARK_MASTER_URI=spark://cc006:7077 ##--->(adjust to the head node)
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=~/anaconda2/envs/test_env/bin/python

- go to your spark installation directory
- then call spark_submit:

./bin/spark-submit --master $SPARK_MASTER_URI ../elephas-explorations/elephas-test.py --nw 4 --ne 10 --bs 32

- this will train a parallelized CNN on MNIST data.
